Firestarter is simple process and shared socket manager, it designed like [circus][] and [einhorn][], it works with lightweight and faster.

Firestarter can manage groups of processes and shared sockets like [circus][]. And like [einhorn][] we support manual ack.
And you can control Firestarter daemon, such as increasing worker process from ctrl command.

Firestarter shares sockets using the `systemd socket passing protocol` (LISTEN_FDS).

Firestarter uses explicit configuration files rather than complex command line options.

## Features

* Easy install
* Fast and saving memory
* Using explicit configuration file
* Support control command like [circus][]
* Support ack like [einhorn][]
* Execute upgrader program

## Installation

You can get `firestarter` by installing it with cargo:

```
$ cargo install firestarter
```

## Usage

Firestarter is process and shared socket manager. Run `firestarter -h` to see detailed usage.

```
firestarter
process and shared socket manager

USAGE:
    firestarter <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    ctrl      Run control client
    help      Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    list      Show worker names
    run       Run daemon
    status    Show worker status
```

Example

```Shell
$ firestarter run --config misc/config.toml
```

The configuration file uses toml. An example is below.

```Toml
[web1] # set worker group name

# set startup process and args
cmd = ["./demo/target/debug/demo"]

# set the number of startup processes
numprocesses = 2

# set working directory
# working_directory = "/tmp"

# set restart policy. default is none
# none: not restart process
# on-failure: restart the process if it is not completed normally
# always: restart the process whenever you exit
restart = "on-failure"

# set the seconds to delay the startup of the process
# warmup_delay = 1

# start the process immediately without starting the process when connecting the client socket
start_immediate = true

# set shared socket addresses
# it also support unix domain socket. (e.g.: /tmp/foo.sock)
socket_address = ["127.0.0.1:4000", "127.0.0.1:4001"]

# set processes environment
environments=["TEST_A=XXXX", "TEST_B=YYYY"]

# set upgrade ack type. this is similar to einhorn 's ACKs. timer is default.
# timer: it will terminate the old process after a certain time (sec).
# manual: send ack manually. For details, refer to einhorn's manual ack document
# none: no ack. simple stop and start
# ack = "manual"

# set timer ack time in seconds
# ack_timeout = 2

# set uid
# uid = 1000

# set gid
# gid = 10

# set stdout to file
# only size rotation is supported
# size:<file size>:<number of backup>:<output path>
# stdout_log = "size:10240:5:/tmp/web1_out.log"

# set stderr to file
# only size rotation is supported
# size:<file size>:<number of backup>:<output path>
# stderr_log = "size:10240:5:/tmp/web1_err.log"

# set process live check configuration
# we will check the existence of the process (experimental).
# the process needs to periodically update the mtime of the file passed in environment variable FIRESTARTER_WATCH_FILE.
# the monitoring process kills the process when the mtime update interval exceeds the threshold. this is the same process as gunicorn's worker notify.
# the unit is seconds, and the default value is 0 (disable live check)
# live_check_timeout = 60

# set auto upgrade
# it will send upgrade command when their command file is modified.
# it does the same processing as circus.plugins.CommandReloader.
# auto_upgrade = false

# set upgrader program
# set the upgrader command.
# run upgrade only when the upgrader command terminates normally.
# upgrader = ["/a/b/upgrader"]

# set upgrade timing
# execute the upgrader command for each specified seconds.
# if not set, execute the upgrade command when executing the upgrade ctrl command.
# upgrader_active_sec=10
# upgrader_timeout=60

[web2] # set other worker group name
#   :
#   :
```

## Control command

Firestarter also provides a client that controls the running daemon.

For example, you can check the status with the following command.

```Shell
$ firestarter ctrl web1 status
send ctrl command [status] to [web1] worker
[web1] active
processes [24170, 24171]
time 00:00:06
```

For details, please refer to the help `firestarter ctrl -h`.
